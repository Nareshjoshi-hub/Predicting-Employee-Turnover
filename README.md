This project focuses on predicting employee turnover using data science and machine learning techniques. Employee turnover, also known as attrition, is a critical issue faced by organizations as it affects productivity, morale, and costs.
This repository provides a detailed implementation of predictive models to analyze employee behavior and identify factors contributing to attrition, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions for employee retention.
Features
1).Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights into key factors influencing employee turnover.
2).Predictive Modeling: Use machine learning algorithms to predict employee attrition.
3).Feature Engineering: Select and transform features to improve model performance.
4).Visualization: Present results using intuitive charts and graphs.
5).Model Evaluation: Assess model accuracy using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
Methodology:
1).Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numeric variables.
2).Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize relationships between employee characteristics and attrition rates.
3).Model Development: Implement algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
4).Model Evaluation: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC to select the best-performing model.

Results:
1).Key Insights: Factors such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, and monthly income significantly impact employee turnover.
2).Best Model: Gradient Boosting achieved the highest accuracy with an F1-score of 0.89.
3).Visualizations: Heatmaps and feature importance plots provide a clear understanding of the data and model performance.
